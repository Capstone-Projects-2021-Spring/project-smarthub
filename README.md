# Welcome to SmartHub!

### Everything you need to know about SmartHub
SmartHub is comprised of two pieces of software. The first piece being the SmartHub Server, which acts as the _smartHub_ for your connected IoT devices on a single profile. Users may have multiple raspberry pi's running a smartHub anywhere in the world. Whether it be rooms in your house, your workplace, or anywhere else, SmartHub will keep you connected.

The second piece of software is the SmartHub Mobile App. This app allows you to communicate with and control all of your SmartHub IoT devices from anywhere in the world. Within the mobile app, you can create profiles for all of your smarthub's, and add devices to each profile to fit whatever needs you may have.

## Usage
### SmartHub Testing Document 
* Download the SmartHub.Acceptance.QA.Testing.doc.xlsx for directions to explore, test, and use all SmartHub features

### SmartHub Server
* smartHub devices are fully configurable and will run with any and all supported devices you'd like. To add a new feature to smartHub, all you need to do is connect the necessary physical device. For example, if you'd like to use your smartHub as a security camera, all you have to do is plug a camera into your rasberry pi. 

### SmartHub Mobile App
1. Sign In / Sign Up by following the on screen instructions after your first launch of the app.
2. Once logged in, create a new profile. A profile represents a location, typically a building or room. _(Ex. Luke's Home or Luke's Front Door)_
3. Navigate inside of that profile and choose what device you would like to add. Click the plus button to add a new device. Choose a unique device name and enter the device domain presented to you during the smartHub installation.
4. Your device is now ready to use.
